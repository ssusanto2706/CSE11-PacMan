# Programming Assignment 8

The program is a simplied version of pacman. The player can use either the 
'WASD' keys to move or the arrow keys to move. Q is used to save and quit. The
pacman goes around and collects pacdots which adds 10 points to the score. The
ghost moves towards the pacman every turn. The pacman is not allowed to move 
outside of the board boundary. Game is over when the pacman overlaps with a 
ghost.

Extra Credit

Pacman rotates to face the direction he is moving. The ghosts are all different
colors.
